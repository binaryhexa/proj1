            Hey.
            <br />
            I'm sorry if i couldn't say this to you personally. I don't know
            how to say this properly though. Just make sure you keep this
            between us. I actually have a crush on you since the first
            semester. I know, i've been silent for
            years. I'm so truly sorry if after this, our friendship is ruined
            because i wrote this kind of "letter". I don't know how you do it,
            but every time i see you, every single time, you always have that
            positive energy you carry that somehow makes me happy, feel
            comforted, feel warm in so many ways. It is bothering me
            sometimes, the feelings i have, i just want to protect you from
            everything. It feels like my fault if you're not doing okay. It's
            like i wanna be there for you, but i can't. Who am i? I wanna be
            your place to share stories, to keep each other safe, to look out
            for each other. The last thing before you close this message: Keep
            being you. You deserve to be happy. It's actually enough for me to
            know that you're happy. If you need someone to talk to, just
            remember i will always be there for you. I'm sorry if this message
            makes you feel uncomfortable.
